Before you make a Discord Bot, you should have a good understanding of JavaScript. This means you should have a basic understanding of the following topics:

- Read and understand docs
- Debug code
- Syntax
- NodeJS module system

If you aren't sure that your understanding of JavaScript is truly good enough to make a bot, you should try to continue learning first. Here are good resources to learn both Javascript and NodeJS:

- _Codecademy_: <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript>
- _Udemy_: <https://www.udemy.com/javascript-essentials/>

- _Nodeschool_: <https://nodeschool.io/>
- _Pluralsight_: <https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js>

Before you ask a question, you should ask these yourself:
1. Is this question related to JavaScript, or the library I am using?
 - If it is the library you are using, go to the proper server. You would get better answers there.
2. Have I tried to google and/or check StackOverflow?
 - Double-check that you can't find anywhere that can lead you to a solution online.
3. Have I tried to look on MDN or the library documentation?
 - You should always check documentation to make sure you aren't missing any details.
4. Does my question make enough sense so that people can understand it, and do they understand what I am trying to accomplish?
 - If no, revise your question. Give as much detail as possible. Include any error or code output that can help us help you.
5. Am I aware of what I am doing, and not just mindlessly copying and pasting?
 - If you are just copying and pasting code from a guide, you are not going to be able to solve anything. Make sure you understand the code you are writing.

[help]
keywords = ["help", "built in help"]
content = """
Our experience from Klasa, and according to many Akairo users, is that built-in help commands suck, and everyone customises them.

Furthermore, having built-in commands forces you to add extra logic in your code (specifically everywhere that reads custom properties from commands), so if you rely on a property to exist, because it does in your commands, it'll break easily with built-in ones unless you overwrite them.

A help command is even worse, they give special constraints that shouldn't exist and can be implemented as you desire.

There are also the people who want to only show specific commands, a list of all commands in one embed, paginated commands, paginated lists of commands (based on categories), and all of that can be in either plain text, inside code blocks (and from there, many syntaxes and formats), or embeds.

To take things further, some people simply want to show all commands, while some other people want to show only the commands the user can use.

And so far we have only covered message-based commands. Chat input commands are a whole different beast because they have native descriptions and if you do have a /help for more details you could use autocomplete to fill out the command name.

If you take all the different ways to format commands, you end up with hundreds or thousands of different possibilities.

We can't deliver a help command that complies with all those possibilities.

Therefore, everyone will eventually replace the built-in one with their own, so why take the effort?

That all said, if you're still looking to make your help command, you can also refer to </tag:961379981123002398> `query: commands` to learn how to get all the commands currently known to Sapphire, from different contexts.

_TL;DR: Do not use [`ts-node`](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node>), use [`tsc-watch`](<https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsc-watch>) instead._

We very strongly discourage using [`ts-node`](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node>) because it was never meant to be used for bots.

[`ts-node`](<https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node>) is designed for [`REPL`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop>) purposes. That's short for `Read Eval Print Loop`.
Which means to read some code, dump it in an `eval()` statement, print the result, and loop.

**_A discord bot is not that._**

A Discord bot sets up a permanent web socket connection to the Discord server and connects to the rest gateway.
There is read yes, but **no eval**, **no print**, and **no loop**.

**So what should you use instead?**

The most ideal way is to just use the `watch` flag of `tsc` (`tsc --watch`) and run `node dist/index.js` to run your bot, then cancel that process and restart it when you have changes that require restarting.
You would open 2 terminal tabs, 1 in which you run `tsc --watch` and another in which you run the bot.
This is, in particular, the most ideal way, because Discord has a limit to the amount of times you can log in with your bot, or register commands, per day.
Constantly logging in over and over again due to an auto-restarting process will get you close to that limit very quickly and once you exceed it, your development will be halted entirely for the current day.

However, this can be quite tedious so a great package to use instead is [`tsc-watch`](<https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsc-watch>).

[yarnv4]
keywords = ["yarn", "yarnv3", "yarnv4"]
content = """
Yarn v4 is a new version of Yarn that we recommend switching to as Yarn v1 has long since been deprecated.

> "But I don't see any update on [source]?"

That is correct. Yarn v4 is installed through Yarn itself. You configure Yarn v4 on a per-project basis. How you installed Yarn globally is largely irrelevant to this (corepack, volta, something else). How to install Yarn v4 for your project? Simply write:
```sh
yarn set version berry
```
This will download the new Yarn v4 binary and put it in `.yarn/releases`, you should push this to your Git repository. It will also create a `.yarnrc.yml` file which configures the path which you should also commit.

Next you probably also want to run the following 2 commands:
```sh
yarn config set enableGlobalCache true
yarn config set nodeLinker node-modules
```
This will add to your `.yarnrc` file:
```yaml
enableGlobalCache: true
nodeLinker: node-modules
```
This ensures you have a more traditional experience with `node_modules` and a global cache.

The next step is to nuke your `node_modules` and `yarn.lock` and run `yarn install`

Then some final adjustments. Put this in you `.gitignore`:
```properties
# Yarn files
.yarn/install-state.gz
.yarn/build-state.yml
```
And anywhere in your scripts in package.json where you use `*` you should wrap it in extra `\"`
For example:
```json
{
	"format": "prettier --write \\"src/**/*.ts\\""
}
```
Mind you this last thing is a good thing to add regardless of script runner/package bundler because it ensures the glob is performed by the library and not by your shell, which may differ when people develop on different operating systems.

In short, the command to set everything up you can run:
```sh
yarn set version berry && yarn config set enableGlobalCache true && yarn config set nodeLinker node-modules && echo "" >> .gitignore && echo "# Yarn files" >> .gitignore && echo ".yarn/install-state.gz" >> .gitignore && echo ".yarn/build-state.yml" >> .gitignore

**Why would I use Sapphire? What is so good about it?**

First of all, you're asking this question in the Sapphire server. This means that you will always get a opinionated reply in favour of Sapphire. If that's not what you're looking for, you should ask the same question in a server like the [discord.js](<https://discord.gg/djs>) server.

Secondly, Sapphire is the only framework for Discord.js that is currently listed in https://discord.com/channels/222078108977594368/729580210634358804. That is to say, it's unofficially the only official discord.js framework.

On to more subtantial reasoning. The core reason to use Sapphire is that sooner or later when writing a Discord bot, you'll be writing your command handler if you don't use Sapphire. At this point you can either choose to write your own framework, or use an existing one. That's where Sapphire comes in. Can you write your own framework? Sure, but why would you? It's a lot of work, and do you really want to maintain that, or do you want just want to write a Discord bot? Using Sapphire will save you the work on the menial tasks and frees that time to actually bring a bot to production, which was the original end goal of writing a bot.
